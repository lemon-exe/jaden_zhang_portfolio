      <p class="norm_text">Since its inception in 1997, the University of Toronto Formula Racing Team (<a href="https://fsaeutoronto.ca">UTFR</a>) has undertaken the task of guilding a formula-style open-wheel race car from scratch annually. We compete in FSAE competitions in the United States as well as europe, specifically in the electric vehicle division. Recently, we dove into driverless vehicle implementation, becoming the first driverless FSAE vehicle in Canada with the UT24 car. </p>
      <p class="norm_text">In my first year on the team, I driven to learn as much as possible of the full design and development cycle of this large-scale project - from contributing to design work, to spending long days and whole nights on manufacturing and assembly, to supporting testing and competition operations. The vast majority of my work in the 2024-2025 season was in the brakes, autonomous brakes (EBS), and steering mechanical subsections of the team. </p>

        <p class="norm_text"> As much as we all love design and CAD, digital models cannot manufacture themselves. One of my main tasks contributing to the UT25 car was manufacturing and machining of a multitude of brakes and steering components, including complex parts such as EBS piston housings and mounting brackets for a custom steering rack.</p>

          <p>The EBS (electronic braking system) housings for autonomous driverless configuration, containing a simple pneumatic piston system to autonomously apply brakes. This was one of the toughest pieces to machine due to the complex construction, tight tolerances, and requiring mixed machining.</p>

          <p>The process of brakes bleeding involves opening the calliper output tube, feeding in brake fluid into the front master cylinder, pumping the brake pedal (with rotors present to avoid calliper piston lockup), and monitoring a tube attached plastic bottle, collecting some brake fluid along with a lot of air bubbles, until no bubbles are present. Much of this process is agitating the fluid in the brass brake lines to convince air bubbles to surface at callipers. </p>

        <p class="norm_text"> Towards the end of the 2024-2025 design season, a major issue in mounting the EBS air tanks arose, as the previously planned mounting method was found to be invalid. I was issued the responsibility of procuring a competition legal EBS air tank mount within a few short days, including measuring, designing/CADing, and manufacturing the mount.</p>
