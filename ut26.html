      <p class="norm_text">Since its inception in 1997, the University of Toronto Formula Racing Team (<a href="https://fsaeutoronto.ca">UTFR</a>) has undertaken the task of guilding a formula-style open-wheel race car from scratch annually. We compete in FSAE competitions in the United States as well as europe, specifically in the electric vehicle division. With the 2025-2026 season, our focus is zoned in on effectively implementing four-wheel drive, as well as optimizing many driverless (DV) assemblies, reducing mass and improving general efficiency.  </p>
      <p class="norm_text">As a senior member in the newly consolidated vehicle controls subsection (encompassing manual and autonomous steering and brakes), my primary focus is to strengthen technical vehicle performance and deepen my exposure to industry design workflows and software processes. Additionally, as new recruits filter into the team, I also contribute to team development by helping train incoming recruits and implementing systematic knowledge transfer through theory-based briefings and practical exercises. </p>

        <p class="norm_text"> As a part of optimizing our DV/autonomous systems, our DV steering system has been revamped from the early-stage iteration last year's chain drive, to a much more low profile and easy maintence shaft-coupled motor. To facilitate this, I was responsible for generating and optimizing an mount to couple the DV steering motor, the iterated custom steering rack, and the vehicle chassis.

        <p class="norm_text"> This 4.5lb full shell spinner fights in the 3lb weight class due to the weight bonus earned by its distinctive movement mechanism: not wheels, but a 4-foot shuffler set. A timing belt driven outter shell is outfitted with UHMW uprights and a hardened steel 2-tooth weapon allows ATLAS v2 to use its rotating shell as both an offensive tool and a  defensive mechanism by deflection. Having competed in more than two years' worth of competition and achieving podium multiple times, v2 is a proven effective design. </p>

          <p>One of the more fun-to-watch fights from ATLAS v2's history. Going up against one of the best vertical spinner bots, 'Orders from the House', this fight resulted in multiple gouges in the bulletproof plexiglass of the surrounding cage. Unfortunately, we did lose this round by our battery ejecting itself due to container failure. This caused an iteration of the battery box (shown in the first image).

          <p>First test of the self-righter in our DIY test box. It functions since when upside down, the shell does not spin - the internals and the titanium shaft does - therefore, by attaching the slanted aluminium piece on top rigid to the shaft, the bot is able to self right. </p>
