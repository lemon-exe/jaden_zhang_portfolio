      <p class="norm_text">With my joining of multiple design teams in my first year studying engineering at the University of Toronto, I had the chance to interact with many design pipelines and best practices for realizing a project from inception. Thus, during my first year's winter break, I commenced my own design project - a 7'' quadcopter remote-controlled drone. Ensuring that I had the full experience of a project, I experienced all aspects of the design process, including brainstorming, iterated candidate designs, design process documentation, CAD/digital modelling, manufacturing, prototyping, and a mind-breaking amount of troubleshooting both electronics and firmware. </p>
      <p class="norm_text">Though still definitely a work-in-progress, the current iteration of the drone flies relatively well and stable, being in flight manuverable and able to land smoothly repeatedly. The next major steps include optimizing (for mass and stiffness) the four motor arms and baseplate by transitioning to thin carbon fiber, as well as revamping battery mounting for better stability and safety.</p>
	  <p class="norm_text">Manufacturing currently paused due to my inability to effectively flash firmware to my Ender3 3D printer without bricking it :(</p>

        <p class="norm_text"> As a part of optimizing our DV/autonomous systems, our DV steering system has been revamped from the early-stage iteration last year's chain drive, to a much more low profile and easy maintence shaft-coupled motor. To facilitate this, I was responsible for generating and optimizing an mount to couple the DV steering motor, the iterated custom steering rack, and the vehicle chassis.

Currently inactive is the DV steering tie rod and motor torque parameters, calculated from the maximum motor torque, while the active manual steering accounts for manual steering column forces. The bump case accounts for a large track mount present in one of our testing locations as well as in FSAE Germany competition. </p>

        <p class="norm_text">A new two-segment steering column calls for a new mounting system to the chassis tubes. I was responsible for the CAD of this connection system, accounting for compatability with both the Driver Interface and Chassis subsections. The designing of the system must also be designed to be easily adjustable (in CAD) and easily manufacturing.</p>

        <li> Made sketches using responsive global variables in assemblies and subassemblies to allow for the easy adjustment of the column angles/lengths, as well as support angles of load-bearing tubes.</li>
        <li> Cross-subsection collaboration to communicate mounting methods, new design constraints and proper mating through assemblies, while utilizing a push-pull collaborative file sharing system</li>
        <li> Iterated on last year's design to optimize for driver comfort, as this component can be very restricting, while retaining the supporting mechanisms</li>
