      <p class="norm_text">With the goal of doing as much physical (and psychological) harm to opposing robots in the ring, we compete mutliple times annually at Botbrawl (Canada) and National Havoc Robot League [NHRL] (United States), with a lineup of unique robots, a couple of which I had a hand in designing/manufacturing.</p>

        <p class="norm_text"> With a ruleset change heavily unfavourable to Atlas V2, we pivoted this year to a new, more compact and efficient 3lb bot design with wheels instead of shufflers, while still retaining the core design philsophies of its ancestor. Currently living in Solidworks, we aim to have a fully functional and troubleshooted robot by mid Janurary 2026. </p>

          <p>One of our newer designs, the angular shell more effectively deflects impacts from other bots, while also lowering center of mass to minimize the chance of being flipped upside down. The steel weapon's counterweight, typically an idle protrusion in most designs, has also been edited to be a vertical brace, providing vertical cover when the shell is spinning. </p>

          <p>Affectionately named 'Cake Atlas' for its shell assembly layout, this shell design is inherited from the previous iteration, providing vertical modularity for the steel weapon to be at the very bottom or between the white UHMW shell spacers. Compared to an angular design, it has a smaller footprint, though is quite susceptible to being overturned in competition. </p>

        <p class="norm_text"> This 4.5lb full shell spinner fights in the 3lb weight class due to the weight bonus earned by its distinctive movement mechanism: not wheels, but a 4-foot shuffler set. A timing belt driven outter shell is outfitted with UHMW uprights and a hardened steel 2-tooth weapon allows ATLAS v2 to use its rotating shell as both an offensive tool and a  defensive mechanism by deflection. Having competed in more than two years' worth of competition and achieving podium multiple times, v2 is a proven effective design. </p>

          <p>One of the more fun-to-watch fights from ATLAS v2's history. Going up against one of the best vertical spinner bots, 'Orders from the House', this fight resulted in multiple gouges in the bulletproof plexiglass of the surrounding cage. Unfortunately, we did lose this round by our battery ejecting itself due to container failure. This caused an iteration of the battery box (shown in the first image).
